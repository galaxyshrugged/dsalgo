Given a snakes and ladder board, find out the minimum move to reach to the top.
Brute force

From any cell the dice throw can decide 6 new positions. So if we try to find out 
all possible paths, it will give 6^n such paths.
Better solution

We can consider any cell of the snakes and ladders board as a vertex. From any vertex we can 
have 6 different vertex where we can go based on the dice throw. We can think of these as 6 edges
with cost 1, going towards 6 different vertexes. We can apply BFS to find the shortest path. We start
from cell 1, we mark all the cells that can be reached by 1 throw of dice as 1. if any one of these 
cells are starting point of a snake or ladder we mark the endpoint of that snake or ladder instead.
So we start from cell 1 and after this step all the cells marked as 1 can be reached by 1 throw. 
Then we put all these nodes in a queue and try to find all the cells that are one throw away from 
those cells. Then we mark them as 2 and put them in queue. In this way when the cell 100 is reached
we found the path. To reconstruct the path we keep the dice throw that caused us to reach a particular
cell and the previous cell from where we reach there in two separate arrays.
